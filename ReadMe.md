## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to classify and assess overall trends and differences between companies in ESG reporting quality over time. A natural language processing model categorized sentences from corporate annual reports based on the level of ESG evidence disclosed. Statistical analysis and visualizations were used to analyze the categorized data. 

The report provides full details on the methodology, results, and conclusions. Key findings include changes in reporting during COVID-19, decreasing emphasis on future intentions over time, and differences between leaders and laggards in ESG disclosure.

The Jupyter notebook contains all code to reproduce the analysis, including data preprocessing, model implementation, classification, and analytical methods.
